    "# Final Analysis\n",
    "When thinking about how to rank the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, we opted to take a multifaceted approach. A given metric may vary massively in its importance between individuals. In order to make account for this variance in our final metric, we as a group chose three qualities in a neighboorhood that are distinct enough to approximate a wide range of preferences - walkability, education, and employment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walkability\n",
    "As stated in greater detail in the `Notebook_Cassano.ipynb`, walkability in our anaylsis comes from a WPRDC dataset that compares the amount of sidewalk distance to the amount of road distance in a given neighborhood. Using this, a ratio can be generated that can be considered a walkability measurement - areas with more sidewalks around their roads can be considered more walkable compared to areas that require cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the statistical analysis, the following neighborhoods came out on top, with the highest walkability values. For the full results, visualizations, and detailed process, again refer back to `Notebook_Cassano.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Neighborhood     |\n",
    "|------|------------------|\n",
    "| 1    | Terrace Village  |\n",
    "| 2    | North Shore      |\n",
    "| 3    | Allegheny Center |\n",
    "| 4    | North Oakland    |\n",
    "| 5    | Larimer          |\n",

    "## Final Metric - RankRank\n",
    "With our three individual ratings, our next task was to somehow incorporate them into a final, composite ranking. Instead of an arbitrary choice, we employed a statistcal method to generate this final rank. When devising the specific method, we felt that each dataset was equally important to the overall quality of a neighborhood. As such, we felt the final ranking should just be a simple combination of the three - an average. Our final metric is simply a ranking of the *average* ordinal rank of each neighborhood across the three datasets. For example, if a neighborhood was ranked 1st in walkability, 3rd in education, and 4th in employment opportunities, the its final value for our composite ranking is 2.67 - an average of the three sub-metric ranks. These composite rankings are then ordered by value, lowest to highest, to produce our final ranking, found below. Since it's a ranking of the ranks, let's call it RankRank!"
